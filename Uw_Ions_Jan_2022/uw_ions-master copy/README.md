# uw_ions
This is the first release of our MD simulation software.

Please download the files mdsim.py and MDfunc.py, and place them in the same folder. For now, don't worry about the other modules.

Try running the code, and at the end, it should produce a scatterplot in 3D of the final ion positions. If you get to this point with no errors, then you have all of the correct packages installed. It should take 3-6 minutes, depending on your computer's specs.

Installation of packages:
-Use anaconda as a package manager if possible
-Install the standard set of packages that come with Anaconda
-Packages used are: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, numba, and tkinter. You may need to update your packages using "conda update (package name here)" in an anaconda prompt.
